I am a junior at Lehigh University where I am a double major in International Relations and Journalism with a minor in French. On campus I am involved in The Brown and White and University Productions. I also hold the position of Vice President Public Relations in the Kappa Delta sororoity. I am passionate about growing a global perspective through connections, life long learning, and listening to people's stories. As a data journalism student I look forward to learning about effective ways to visualize data and make an impact.

This graphic shows how students are divided between colleges within Lehigh University. It also shows the makeup of gender within each college. The College of Arts and Sciences is the largest college at Lehigh, and it is dominated by women, while the the College of Engineering & Application Sciences, College of Business, Arts/Engineering, and Intercollegiate Programs are dominated by men. There is a large disparity of women in Engineering & Application Sciences, which helps to explains why we continue to see jobs in STEM majorly occupied by males.

There is a positive correlation between life satisfaction and GDP, but this correlation is not extremely strong. FOr example, there are some data points on this chart with about 40K GDP and high life satisfaction, while life satisfaction was lower for a country with a GDP per capita of about 95K.

Data Source can be found [HERE](https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm)

This chart shows unemployment rates across the United States during the entire year of 2020. This is especially interesting because we can see the affects that the pandemic had on unemployment starting in March of 2020. The trend that this chart follows shows us how unemployment rose drastically when the pandemic hit. After the initial rise in unemployment that is seen during March, it begins on a negative slope back down, yet remains higher than the unemployment rate was before COVID-19.

This map was made by Aliya Haddon with information from [Culture Trip](https://theculturetrip.com/asia/articles/the-10-most-visited-cities-in-the-world/). The data used came from [MasterCard's Global Destination Cities Index](https://newsroom.mastercard.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MasterCard-GDCI-2015-Final-Report1.pdf). I chose this topic to focus on because I love to travel and hope to gain many more traveling experiences in life to expand my view of the world. This was interesting to look into because I was able to compare my perspective with the reality of where other people are traveling to often. London, UK is the most visited city in the world with 15.29 million povernight visitors in 2015.
