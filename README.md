I am a junior at Lehigh University where I am a double major in International Relations and Journalism with a minor in French. On campus I am involved in The Brown and White and University Productions. I also hold the position of Vice President Public Relations in the Kappa Delta sororoity. I am passionate about growing a global perspective through connections, life long learning, and listening to people's stories. As a data journalism student I look forward to learning about effective ways to visualize data and make an impact. 



# Lehigh University Undergraduate Enrollment

This graphic shows how students are divided between colleges within Lehigh University. It also shows the makeup of gender within each college. The College of Arts and Sciences is the largest college at Lehigh, and it is dominated by women, while the the College of Engineering & Application Sciences, College of Business, Arts/Engineering, and Intercollegiate Programs are dominated by men. There is a large disparity of women in Engineering & Application Sciences, which helps to explains why we continue to see jobs in STEM majorly occupied by males.

This infographic shows the batting averages of Lehigh's softball team. The player with the highest average of the 2020 season was Carley Barjaktarovich with .352. This data was especially interesting to me because I used to play softball. Anyone else interested in the performance of Lehigh's team may be interested in this graphic as well. This infographic was made on Canva.

This is a bar chart created with Chartbuilder. This chart describes the makeup of Lehigh's undergraduate population by ethnicity. Over half of Lehigh's undergraduate population is white, with 10% or less making up other ethnicities.

Data source can be found [HERE](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction)

The Y axis represents life satisfaction in different countries around the world measured with the Cantril Ladder. The X axis represents GDP per capita in thousands for these respective countries. There is a positive correlation between life satisfaction and GDP, but this correlation is not extremely strong. FOr example, there are some data points on this chart with about 40K GDP and high life satisfaction, while life satisfaction was lower for a country with a GDP per capita of about 95K.



# 2020 Unemployment Rate by Month
![2020 Unemployment Rates](https://github.com/aliya-haddon/aliya-haddon.github.io/blob/main/2020_Unemployment_Rate_by_Month_Unemployment_Rate_chartbuilder-2.png?raw=true)

Data Source can be found [HERE](https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm)

This chart shows unemployment rates across the United States during the entire year of 2020. This is especially interesting because we can see the affects that the pandemic had on unemployment starting in March of 2020. The trend that this chart follows shows us how unemployment rose drastically when the pandemic hit. After the initial rise in unemployment that is seen during March, it begins on a negative slope back down, yet remains higher than the unemployment rate was before COVID-19.

This map was made by Aliya Haddon with information from [Culture Trip](https://theculturetrip.com/asia/articles/the-10-most-visited-cities-in-the-world/). The data used came from [MasterCard's Global Destination Cities Index](https://newsroom.mastercard.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MasterCard-GDCI-2015-Final-Report1.pdf). I chose this topic to focus on because I love to travel and hope to gain many more traveling experiences in life to expand my view of the world. This was interesting to look into because I was able to compare my perspective with the reality of where other people are traveling to often. London, UK is the most visited city in the world with 15.29 million povernight visitors in 2015.

These two charts show a comparison of which type of parties are prefered at Lehigh with the parties that people pregame more for. These data sets are also separated by gender for further analysis. When looking at these two c harts, some of the comparissons we can make are intreaguing, but may need more information to make further conclusions. For example, we see that fewer Females at Lehigh prefer fraternity house parties compared to off campus parties, while females pregame more for fraternity house parties than they do for off campus parties. Why is this? Are these women drinking more for the fraternity parties to make a less prefered party more lively and fun. Could it be to make them feel less uncomfortable or awkward? Another interesting part of these graphs is that males prefered fraternity house parties more than they did off campus parties. Males also prefered fraternity parties more than females did. Are these things true because the males are the ones living in the fraternity houses and would therefore rather have the convenience of staying? Can the fraternity houses host a larger capacity that is more desirable to the males who are throwing the parties for their fraternities? The comparisons between these charts beg for more research to answer these types of questions.
