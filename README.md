I am a junior at Lehigh University where I am a double major in International Relations and Journalism with a minor in French. On campus I am involved in The Brown and White and University Productions. I also hold the position of Vice President Public Relations in the Kappa Delta sororoity. I am passionate about growing a global perspective through connections, life long learning, and listening to people's stories. As a data journalism student I look forward to learning about effective ways to visualize data and make an impact.

This graphic shows how students are divided between colleges within Lehigh University. It also shows the makeup of gender within each college. The College of Arts and Sciences is the largest college at Lehigh, and it is dominated by women, while the the College of Engineering & Application Sciences, College of Business, Arts/Engineering, and Intercollegiate Programs are dominated by men. There is a large disparity of women in Engineering & Application Sciences, which helps to explains why we continue to see jobs in STEM majorly occupied by males.
